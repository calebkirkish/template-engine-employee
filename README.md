## Description
Create an application that creates your own personal dream team of who you would want on your team.

## Installation
npm i 'inquirer', 'fs', 'jest'

## Usage
When running the program you will first select who the manager is (usually whoever is creating this would be the manager), then after you create the manager you will be given the choice to add some engineers or some interns, create as many as you need making sure you fill out the form as much as possible. Once you have created your team just select 'Complete team' and it will out put an html file that will clearly label who is who and all the information you provided.

## Test
I have some tests running on each of the files in the lib/ directory that tests the output of each of the functions to properly ideally create the correct information.
